          <h3> <b>What is the nervous system?</b></h3>
          <p> Nearly all of your actions, thoughts, words, and emotions are controlled by your nervous system. It
            manages
            complex functions like memory, thought, and movement. Additionally, it is crucial for bodily functions like
            breathing, blushing, and blinking that occur automatically.</p>
          <h3><b>what does the nervous system do?</b></h3>
          <p> Neurons are specialized cells that your nervous system uses to send signals or messages throughout your
            body.
            These electrical signals are sent and received by your muscles, organs, glands, skin, and brain. You can
            move your
            limbs and experience sensations like pain thanks to the messages. Information about your surroundings is
            taken in by
            your eyes, ears, tongue, nose, and all of the nerves throughout your body. Nerves then transfer that
            information to
            and from your brain. Signals sent by various neuronal types vary. Your muscles are told to move by motor
            neurons.
            Your brain receives signals from sensory neurons that process information from your senses. Other varieties
            of
            neurons manage automatic bodily functions like breathing, shivering, a regular heartbeat, and food
            digestion.</p>
          <h3><b> What are the parts of the nervous system?</b></h3>
          <h4>Central Nervous System</h4>
          <p>Your CNS is made up of your brain and spinal cord. Your nerves are used by your brain to communicate with
            the rest
            of your body. A layer of protection called myelin surrounds each nerve. Myelin protects the nerve and aids
            in the
            transmission of signals. </p>
          <h4>Peripheral Nervous System</h4>
          <p> Your body's peripheral nervous system is made up of numerous nerves that branch off from your central
            nervous
            system (CNS). Your organs, arms, legs, fingers, and toes receive information from your brain and spinal cord
            through
            this system.</p>
          <h3> <b>Diseases of Nervous system:</b></h3>
          <p> Stroke, Accedintal injury, Pressure, Aging process and Toxic substances </p>
