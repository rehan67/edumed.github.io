          <h1> Skeletal system</h1>
          <h3> What is the Skeletal system? </h3>
          <p>All of the bones, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments in the human body make up the skeletal system. A
            person's
            skeleton makes up about 20% of their total body weight, according to a reliable source. </p>
          <p>The 206 bones in an adult's skeleton are number. Because some of the bones, such as those in the skull,
            fuse
            together as people age, children's skeletons actually have more bones than adults.The skeletons of men and
            women
            differ in a few other ways as well. The average male skeleton is longer and has more bone mass. Contrarily,
            the
            female skeleton has a wider pelvis to allow for pregnancy and childbirth.
          <p>The skeletal system can be divided into two parts, known as the axial skeleton and the appendicular
            skeleton,
            regardless of age or gender.</p>
          <h3>Axial skeleton anatomy</h3>
          <p>There are 80 bones in the axial skeleton of an adult. It is composed of the bones that make up the body's
            vertical
            axis, including those in the head, neck, chest, and spine. </p>
          <h4> 22 Skull bones</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>cranial bones:</b> skull's 8 cranial bones make up the majority of it. They assist in defending your
              brain.
            </li>
            <li><b>facial bones</b> The 14 facial bones are counted. They make up the face and are located on the front
              of the
              skull. </li>
          </ul>
          <h4> Auditory ossicles</h4>
          <p> The inner ear canal of the skull contains six tiny bones called the auditory ossicles. On each side of the
            head,
            there are three auditory ossicles that Together, they enable sound waves from the environment to reach the
            inner ear
            structures.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b> malleus</b> </li>
            <li><b>incus</b></li>
            <li><b>stapes</b> </li>
          </ol>
          <h4> Hyoid</h4>
          <p> a U-shaped bone that can be found at the jaw's base. It functions as a neck joint where ligaments and
            muscles
            attach.</p>
          <h4>Vertebral column</h4>
          <p> There are 26 bones in the vertebral column. All 24 of the first vertebrae are then followed by the sacrum
            and
            coccyx (tailbone).</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>cervical vertebrae:</b> The head and neck contain these seven bones. </li>
            <li><b>Thoracic vertebrae:</b> The upper back contains these 12 bones.</li>
            <li><b>Lumbar vertebrae:</b> The lower back contains these five bones.</li>
          </ol>
          <p> Both<b>the sacrum and the coccyx </b> are constructed from a number of fused vertebrae. They aid in
            supporting the
            body's weight while seated. They also act as points of attachment for different ligaments.</p>
          <h4>Thoracic cage</h4>
          <p> The sternum (breastbone) and 12 pairs of ribs make up the thoracic cage. The upper torso organs, such as
            the heart
            and lungs, are encased in a cage made of these bones.

            Some of the ribs connect to the sternum directly, while others do so via cartilage. Some are referred to as
            "floating ribs" because they have no points of attachment.</p>



          <h3> Appendicular skeleton anatmoy</h3>
          <p> The appendicular skeleton contains 126 bones in total. Along with the bones that connect them to the axial
            skeleton, it is made up of the bones that make up the arms and legs.</p>
          <h4> Pectoral girdle</h4>
          <p> The arms connect to the axial skeleton at the pectoral girdle. The clavicle (collarbone) and scapula make
            up its
            structure (shoulder blade). Each of these comes in pairs, one for each arm.</p>
          <h4> Upper limb</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>The humerus </b> is the long bone of the upper arm.</li>
            <li><b>The radius</b> is one of two long bones of the forearm, found on the thumb side.</li>
            <li><b>The ulna</b> is the second long bone of the forearm, found on the pinky finger side. </li>
            <li><b>The carpals</b> are a group of eight bones found in the wrist area. </li>
            <li><b>The metacarpals</b> are five bones found in the middle area of the hand. </li>
            <li><b>The phalanges</b> are 14 bones that make up the fingers. </li>
          </ul>
          <h4> Pelvic gridle </h4>
          <p> The legs connect to the axial skeleton at the pelvic girdle, also referred to as the hips. There are two
            hipbones
            in it, one for each leg.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Ilium</li>
            <li>Ischium</li>
            <li> Pubis </li>
          </ol>
          <h4> Lower limb</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Femur </li>
            <li> Tibia</li>
            <li> Fibula</li>
            <li> Patella</li>
            <li> Tarsals </li>
            <li> Metatarsals </li>
            <li> Phalanges </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>What is the function of the skeletal system?</h3>
          <p>
            preventing damage to internal organs For instance, the thoracic cage protects the heart and lungs while the
            skull
            shields the brain, allowing for movement. Tendons allow muscles to connect to bones. This link enables the
            body to
            move in a variety of ways, including the production of blood cells. Numerous bones contain soft bone marrow,
            which
            makes platelets, white blood cells, and red blood cells in addition to storing minerals and nutrients.
            Calcium and
            phosphorus, two minerals that are crucial for numerous bodily processes, can be stored and released by
            bones. A
            portion of the bone marrow also contains adipose (fat) tissue that can be used as energy.</p>
          <h3> Diseases of skeletal system are:</h3>
          <p> Fracrures,metabloic bone disease, artheritis,cancer and spinal curvatures</p>
