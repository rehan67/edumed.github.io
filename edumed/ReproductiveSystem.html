          <h1> Reproductive system</h1>
          <h3> <b>What is the reproductive system?</b></h3>
          <p>the system of organs and parts which function in reproduction consisting in the male especially of the
            testes,
            penis, seminal vesicles, prostate, and urethra and in the female especially of the ovaries, fallopian tubes,
            uterus,
            vagina, and vulva. </p>
          <h3><b>The difference between female and male is:</b> </h3>
          <h4> The female reproductive system </h4>

          <p>The female reproductive organs are the vagina, womb (uterus), fallopian tubes and ovaries:
            <br /><ins>Vagina </ins> – a muscular canal around 7.5 cm long that extends from the neck of the womb to the
            genitals, or vulva.
            <br /><ins>Uterus (womb)</ins> – a muscular organ, shaped like an upside down pear. Its lining is called
            the<b>
              endometrium </b>. The neck or entrance to the womb is the cervix, which has a small hole in its centre
            called the
            os.
            <br /><ins>Fallopian (uterine) tubes</ins> – these tubes extend from the womb, one on each side. They both
            open near
            an ovary. These tubes carry the egg (ovum) from the ovary to the womb.
            <br /><ins>Ovaries</ins> – two small almond-shaped glands that contain ova. Sex hormones are also made by
            the
            ovaries.
          </p>

          <h4> The male reproductive system</h4>
          <p> The male reproductive organs are the penis, the testicles, the epididymis, the vas deferens and the
            prostate
            gland:
            <br /><ins>Penis </ins> – contains tissue that fills with blood during sexual arousal, making the penis
            erect (or
            ‘hard’). Semen is a mixture of sperm and fluid from the male reproductive organs. It exits the penis,
            through the
            urethra, during ejaculation.
            <br /><ins>Testicles (testes)</ins> – oval sex glands located in a skin sack called the scrotum. Sperm and
            sex
            hormones are made by the testicles. Keeping the testicles outside of the body means they have a lower
            temperature
            than the rest of the body, which is important for sperm production.
            <br /><ins>Epididymis </ins>– a series of small tubes attached to the back of each testicle. The epididymis
            collects
            and stores sperm.
            <br /><ins>Vas deferens </ins> – the epididymis eventually becomes the vas deferens, a larger tube that
            transports
            sperm to the urethra (the urinary passage from the bladder).
            <br /><ins>Accessory sex glands</ins> – including the prostate gland, seminal vesicles and the bulbourethral
            glands.
            These glands contribute nourishing fluid to the sperm.
          </p>
