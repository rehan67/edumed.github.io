          <h1> CIRCULATORY SYSTEM </h1>
          <p> Your circulatory system, also referred to as your cardiovascular system, is a collection of organs that
            work in unison to perform a crucial task. It is responsible for getting oxygen and nutrients to all body organs and
            for removing waste products like carbon dioxide and toxins from the body. It is made up of the heart, vessels,
            and lymphatic circulation. Numerous conditions, including high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, angina,
            arrhythmia,blood clots, and varicose veins, can impair the circulatory system's ability to function properly. You can
            prevent these conditions by being aware of them.</p>
          <h3> WHAT IS THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM?</h3>
          <p>The heart and blood vessels, through which blood travels, form an amazing network. Our organs receive
            oxygenated blood and nutrients from these vessels, which also help remove waste materials and carbon dioxide from the
            tissues and organs. By performing this exchange, the circulatory system aids in maintaining the health and life of
            our cells. The circulatory system understands how hard it needs to pump blood by listening to all the signals
            sent by the body's various organs. For life to exist, the circulatory system is necessary.</p>


          <h3> PARTS OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM </h3>
          <p> The circulatory system is made up of numerous components, each of which performs a distinct task to keep
            the body
            in
            good health. The heart, the arteries, the veins, and the capillaries are the four components of this
            intricate
            system.
            Your heart can miraculously pump up to five liters (1.3 gallons) of blood per minute. And if you assume a
            resting
            heart rate of between 60 and 100 beats per minute, it will have beat up to 2.5 billion times by the time you
            are 70
            years old. </p>
          <h5>THE HEART </h5>
          <p>The heart is the center of the circulatory system. You can fully understand the entire circulatory system
            when you
            comprehend this strong muscle and its operations. Because it is situated in the middle of the circulatory
            system,
            this
            organ is unique. It is constructed of numerous layers. </p>

          <p> <b>The pericardium </b>is the wrap around the heart that keeps it in its place. It contains fluids that
            act as
            lubricants preventing friction of the cavities. The pericardium itself is made of two layers: <b>The
              visceral
              layer</b> that directly covers the heart, and <b> the parietal layer</b> that is the sac containing the
            fluid.</p>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th></th>
              <th> The layers of heart walls: </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Epicardium </th>
              <td> is in the exterior of the heart which lubricated and shielded </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th> Mayocardium </th>
              <td> the thickest part of the heart,which indicateto the macsular layer</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th> Endocardium</th>
              <td> The inner, smooth heart tissue which acts as a barrier against blood clotting and adhesion to the
                heart.</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <h4> THE BLOOD VESSELS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li class="mt-2"> <strong>The veins </strong> are in charge of returning low oxygen blood to the heart so that it can
              receive the
              oxygen it needs.</li>

            <li class="mt-2"> <strong>the capilliries</strong> which connect the veins and arteries. Oxygen, nutrients, and waste are
              exchanged
              between the organs, tissues, and blood in the spaces between the capillaries yet The smallest and most
              numerous
              blood vessels in the body</li>

            <li class="mt-2"> <strong> the atreries</strong> are the tubes responsible for carrying oxygen-rich blood to the organs
              and
              tissues. The largest artery, the aorta, serves as the origin of the other smaller arteries.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3> HOW DOES YOUR CIRCULATORY SYSTEM WORK?</h3>
          <p> The sole purpose of your heart is to pump blood into your circulatory system. Contraction and relaxation,
            which
            typically occur back-to-back, are the cause of this. Systole and diastole are the terms used to describe
            contraction
            and relaxation, respectively. The rhythmic patterns of these two allow the blood to be pumped. Thus, they
            combine to
            create the cardiac cycle, also known as the heartbeat, which lasts for about one second.</p>
          <h3> DISEASES OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM ARE:</h3>
          <p> Atherosclerosis,High blood pressure,Angina,Arrythemia,Varicose veins , blood clots, heart atacks ,
            stroke,heart
            failure, heart valve problems ,Heart inflammation,Aneurysm,Congenital heart disease and Vasculitis</p>
