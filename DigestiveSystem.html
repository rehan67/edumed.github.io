          <h1> Digestive System</h1>
          <h3> What is the digestive system?</h3>
          <p> The gastrointestinal tract, along with your liver, pancreas, and gallbladder, make up your digestive
            system. The
            GI tract is made up of a number of interconnected hollow organs that extend from your mouth to your anus.
            Your mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and anus are the organs that make up your GI
            tract, in the order that they are joined.</p>
          <h3>Whats the function of the Digestive system? </h3>
          <p>Your digestive system is specially designed to carry out its function of converting food into the nutrients
            and
            energy you require to survive. After that, it conveniently packages your solid waste, or stool, for disposal
            the
            next time you have a bowel movement. </p>
          <h3>Why is digestion important?</h3>
          <p> Because your body needs the nutrients from the food you eat and the liquids you drink to stay healthy and
            function
            properly, digestion is crucial. Carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water are all
            examples of
            nutrients. The nutrients in the food and liquids you consume are broken down and absorbed by your digestive
            system
            for use in vital processes like cell growth, repair, and energy production.</p>
          <h3> What organs make up the digestive system?</h3>
          <!-- a table that summurize all the organs-->
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th></th>
              <th> Organs of the digestive system </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Mouth </th>
              <td>the start of the digestive system. In actuality, digestion begins before taking a bite. As soon as the
                person
                smell or see food, the salivary glands start to work. When start eating, chewing food to break it up
                into pieces
                to become easier to digest. saliva begins to break down the food into a form that body can absorb and
                use. The
                tongue moves the food from mouth into throat and esophagus when swallowing. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th> Esophagus </th>
              <td> food travels from mouth to esophagus, which is situated in throat close to the trachea. A tiny flap
                called
                epiglottis covers your windpipe while swallowing to prevent choking. Food enters stomach through
                peristalsis
                process, which involves a series of muscular contractions in the esophagus, but before food can enter
                your
                stomach, the lower esophageal sphincter, which resembles a ring, must relax. The sphincter then
                tightens,
                stopping the stomach contents from returning to the esophagus. If it doesn't, acid reflux or heartburn
                might
                happen as these contents flow back into the esophagus.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <th> Stomach</th>
              <td> The stomach is a hollow organ that serves as a "container" for food as it is combined with stomach
                enzymes.
                These enzymes continue turning food into a form that can be consumed. The breakdown process is carried
                out by
                strong acids and potent enzymes secreted by cells in the lining of the stomach. The stomach's contents
                are
                released into the small intestine once they have been sufficiently processed.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Small intestine </th>
              <td> The small intestine, which consists of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, is a muscular tube measuring
                22 feet
                in length and used to break down food using pancreatic enzymes and bile from the liver. The movement of
                food
                through this organ while it is being mixed with pancreatic and liver juices during peristalsis is
                another
                function of this organ.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Pancreas</th>
              <td>Digestive enzymes are secreted into the duodenum by the pancreas, where they break down protein, fats,
                and
                carbohydrates. Additionally, the pancreas produces insulin and delivers it directly into the blood. The
                primary
                hormone in the body for metabolizing sugar is insulin.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th> Liver </th>
              <td> Although the liver performs a variety of tasks in the digestive system, processing the nutrients
                taken up
                from the small intestine is its primary duty. Digesting fat and some vitamins requires the help of bile,
                which
                the liver secretes into the small intestine.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Gallbladder</th>
              <td> Bile from the liver is concentrated and stored in the gallbladder before being released into the
                duodenum of
                the small intestine to aid in the absorption and digestion of fats.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <th> Colon</th>
              <td> In order to make it simple and convenient to empty your bowels, the colon is in charge of processing
                waste.
                The muscular tube that joins the small intestine to the rectum is 6 feet long. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th> Rectum</th>
              <td> The 8-inch-long, straight chamber known as the rectum joins the colon to the anus. The rectum's
                duties
                include collecting stool from the colon, alerting the person to the presence of stool, and holding the
                stool
                until evacuation occurs. Sensors alert the brain when anything (such as gas or stool) enters the rectum.
                The
                decision to release the rectal contents is then made by the brain.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th> Anus</th>
              <td>The last section of the digestive system is the anus. The pelvic floor muscles and the two anal
                sphincters are
                located in a 2-inch canal (internal and external). Rectal contents can be felt by the upper anus lining.
                It
                informs the person of the contents liquid, gas, or solid state. </td>
