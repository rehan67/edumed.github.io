          <h1> Urinary system</h1>
          <p> Urinary or Renal system consists of numerous organs and muscles make up the urinary system, which
            produces,
            stores, and excretes urine. Waste products are the only things left over after your body digests food and
            liquids to
            absorb their nutrients. Urine is one of them. The liquid waste that results from the breakdown of
            protein-containing
            foods is known as<b><i> Urea</i></b> .</p>
          <p><dfn> Urea</dfn> is one of your body's main waste products and becomes urine when combined with water and
            other
            minerals to help keep the balance of chemicals and water in your body, your urinary system filters waste
            while
            communicating constantly with other organs.</p>
          <h3>The organs of the urinary system:</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>Kidney:</dt>
            <dd> You have two kidneys from birth. Each of them is a bean-shaped organ that is about the size of a closed
              fist.
              Your kidneys, which are situated just below either side of your rib cage, are always at work. The nephrons
              in the
              kidneys function as a microscopic filtering system to remove urea from the blood. Additionally, they
              filter
              extraneous chemicals, ions, and other metabolic waste. Your kidneys will filter about 120 to 150 quarts of
              blood
              every single day, regardless of what you're doing.</dd>
            <dt>Ureters</dt>
            <dd> The ureters transport the filtered urine from the kidneys to the bladder. A ureter connects each kidney
              to the
              bladder, which is almost constantly emptied of minute amounts of urine. One of the reasons you should
              avoid
              holding your urine for an extended period of time is because movement is crucial to prevent infection in
              the
              ureters.</dd>
            <dt>Bladder </dt>
            <dd> Urine that has been emptied into the bladder sits there until you need to urinate. In order to match
              urine
              output, your bladder, which is situated in your lower abdomen, can impressively contract and expand. You
              can
              urinate when you need to empty your bladder thanks to voluntary muscle control. The amount of water in the
              body,
              kidney output, and bladder size all affect how often you urinate. A typical bladder can hold 1.5 to 2 cups
              of
              urine for 2 to 5 hours on average.</dd>
            <dt> Sphincter Muscles </dt>
            <dd> Your bladder's sphincter muscles remain contracted to prevent leakage. They can close very tightly and
              are
              circular, almost like wrapping a rubber band around the opening of your bladder. If you have issues with
              incontinence, your sphincter muscles are probably weak.</dd>
            <dt>Nerves of the bladder </dt>
            <dd> Your bladder nerves are activated when you finally feel the need to urinate. These are what make you
              feel alert
              and indicate that you need to find a bathroom. </dd>
            <dt>Urethra </dt>
            <dd> Your urethra will carry your urine out of your body after you receive the signal that it's time to
              urinate. All
              of these processes are efficiently carried out by your body, but mistakes can still occur.</dd>
          </dl>
          <h3> The Importance of the Urinary System </h3>
          <p> Your body can successfully filter blood through the urinary system, which also produces urine as waste
            material,
            stores it, and excretes it. But it does more than just that. As it works to preserve homeostasis and produce
            necessary hormones, the urinary tract system is a crucial component of your body's overall maintenance.</p>
          <h3> Diseases of the Urinary system are:</h3>
          <p> <abbr title="Urinary Tract Infection">UTI</abbr> , kidney stones, urinary retention , Urinary
            incontinence,<abbr title=" Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia">BPH</abbr> and Benign Prostitis </p>
